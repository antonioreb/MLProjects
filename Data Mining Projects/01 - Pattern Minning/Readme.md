This project was made in the context of the Data Mining course (2020) of Lisbon University. 
There are three datasets that have info collected from an online Store collected over 4 months (April - July 2014) (more info in the notebook). These files have the following info:
  - what items were bought
  - what items were clicked
  - product information

The task was divided in two:
 - Compute and analyze frequent itemsets and association rules
