# Pattern Mining Project

This project was made in the context of the Data Mining course (2020) of Lisbon University. 
There are three datasets that have info collected from an online Store collected over 4 months (April - July 2014) (more info in the notebook). These files have the following info:
  - what items were bought
  - what items were clicked
  - product information

The task was divided in two steps:
 - Compute and analyze frequent itemsets and association rules for the whole dataset. A thorough analysis was included that answered questions like:
     - What are the most interesting products?
     - What are the most bought products?
     - Which products are bought together?
     - Can you find associations between the clicked products?
     - Can you find associations highliting that when people buy a product/set of products also buy other product(s)?
     - Can you find associations highliting that when people click in a product/set of products also buy that product(s)?
     - Can you find relevant associated categories?
 - For the second part we compared week vs weekend trends. Some of the questions in this case were:
    -Are the most interesting products the same during the week and the weekend?
    - What are the most bought products during the week? What about the weekend?
    - Are there differences between the sets of products bought during the week and the weekend?
    - Can you find different associations highliting that when people click in a product/set of products also buy that product(s) during the week vs the weekend?
