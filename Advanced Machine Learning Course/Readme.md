These mini projects/exercises were made in the context of the Advanced Machine Learning course from the Faculty of Science from Lisbon University (2020). This is a modular course in which severall algorithms and approaches to machine learning are covered. At the end we had to make a big final project of our choice (in my case I chose to do a live face mask position classifier).

In each folder there is a detailed descrition of what was asked in the exercise
