Exercise 1 - SOM
0) install SOMPY (pip is not recommended):

go to GitHub - sevamoo/SOMPY and download the project (alternatively, you can also clone the project)

python setup.py install
1) in the jupyter notebook environment run the examples in https://gist.github.com/sevamoo/035c56e7428318dd3065013625f12a11

2) generate 30 random points centered on each face of a cube of side 2 with geometric center in the origin

3) run SOMPY on this dataset

4) (optional) repeat 2 and 3, generating 30 points around each face center in 3D, i.e. in a small volume around the center of each face (instead of lying on the face)

Exercise 2 - Hopfield
0) install NeuPy

1) do the exercises in http://neupy.com/2015/09/20/discrete_hopfield_network.html#example

experiment results of storing and recalling more patterns maintaining the size of the network
