Following the link below, do the set of exercises on your computer.

1. Run the examples presented in the link for the iris dataset.
2. For the iris dataset, set a gamma and C value and try running a polynomial SVM kernel with different degree values.
3. Do the practice problem from the link by:
	- finding the additional feature to have a hyper-plane that separates the classes
	- visualizing in 3D the separation of the data (since the actual point positions are not provided, use approximate coordinates for the blue star and red dot points)
